#  Game: Fill the Bottle! - Python Help Exercise

Hello Python community!

Recently, I had the pleasure of conducting Python Help classes, where two students collaborated on an exciting project for their college. I'd like to share with you the result of this collaborative effort: the "Fill the Bottle" game.

## Project Description:

Fill the Bottle is a simple Python game created to help the students solidify basic concepts of the programming language. In this interactive game, players compete to fill a virtual bottle without letting it overflow. If the bottle overflows, the player loses.

## Covered Concepts:

- **Functions:** We implemented functions to organize the code and facilitate understanding.
- **Lists:** We used lists to store crucial data for the game.
- **Organization:** We focused on an organized code structure to promote good programming practices.
- **Programming Logic:** We developed the game logic to ensure an engaging experience.

## How to Play:

1. Run the Python script.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to fill the bottle.
3. Avoid letting the bottle overflow!

## How to Contribute:

Feel free to explore, make improvements, and contribute to this project. We are open to suggestions and collaborations. Together, we can make Fill the Bottle even more amazing!

## Usage Instructions:

```bash
$ python fill_the_bottle.py
```

## Acknowledgments:

I want to express my gratitude to the students who participated in this project, making it a valuable learning experience for all of us.

Enjoy playing and coding!
