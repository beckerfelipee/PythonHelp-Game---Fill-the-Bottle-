#  Fill the Bottle! - Python Help Exercise

Hello Python community!

Recently, I had the opportunity to lead Python Help classes, where two students worked together on a project for their college. I'd like to share with you the outcome of this collaborative effort: the 'Fill the Bottle' game.

## Project Description:

Fill the Bottle is a simple Python game created to help the students solidify basic concepts of the programming language. In this interactive game, players compete to fill a virtual bottle without letting it overflow. If the bottle overflows, the player loses.

## Covered Concepts:

- **Functions:** We implemented functions to organize the code and facilitate understanding.
- **Lists:** We used lists to store crucial data for the game.
- **Organization:** We focused on an organized code structure to promote good programming practices.
- **Programming Logic:** We developed the game logic to ensure an engaging experience.

## How to Play:

1. Run the Python script.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to fill the bottle.
3. Avoid letting the bottle overflow!
